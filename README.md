# **BlenderRender state plugin for Prism Pipeline 2**
A plugin to be used with version 2 of Prism Pipeline 

Prism automates and simplifies the workflow of animation and VFX projects.

You can find more information on the website:

https://prism-pipeline.com/


## **Plugin Usage**

BlenderRender adds a new state to the StateManager.  This state adds additional functionality to Prism's Blender rendering compared to the more generic default ImageRender.





## **Installation**

This plugin is for Windows only, as Prism2 only supports Windows at this time.

You can either download the latest stable release version from: [Latest Release](https://github.com/AltaArts/DeleteFunctions--Prism-Plugin/releases/latest)

or download the current code zip file from the green "Code" button above or on [Github](https://github.com/JBreckeen/DeleteFunctions--Prism-Plugin/tree/main)

Copy the directory named "BlenderRender" to a directory of your choice, or a Prism2 plugin directory.

Prism's default plugin directories are: *{installation path}\Plugins\Apps* and *{installation Path}\Plugins\Custom*.

It is suggested to have all custom plugins in a seperate folder suchs as: *{drive}\ProgramData\Prism2\plugins\CustomPlugins*

You can add the additional plugin search paths in Prism2 settings.  Go to Settings->Plugins and click the gear icon.  This opens a dialogue and you may add additional search paths at the bottom.

Once added, you can either restart Prism2 (prefered) or select the "Add existing plugin" (plus icon) and navigate to where you saved the DeleteFunctions folder and then click the "Reload all plugins" button.
