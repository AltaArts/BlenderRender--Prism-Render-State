# BlenderRender--Prism-Render-State

*** WIP ***

Will eventually finish converting to a proper plugin.

As of now, this must overwrite a Prism file -- be sure to make a backup.

Install:

- Overwrite "Prism_Blender_Functions.py" located in [route_to_Blender_plugin]\Scripts\
- Copy the "BlenderRender" dir from the repo to your Prism plugin directory.
- Register the BlenderRender plugin as normal.
